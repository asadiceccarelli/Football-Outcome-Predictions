# Football Outcome Predictions
My forth and final project for AiCore. Building a machine learning model to make predictions for upcoming games and set odds for betting companies to maximise profit.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup

- A new conda environment has been set up with the name ```football-env``` from which the package requirements needed for the projects can be created in a ```requirements.txt``` file. Git branches will be used throughout the project following the Gitflow branching model.
